# Tata Data Analytics Project

This repository contains my data analytics project completed as part of the *Tata Group Virtual Internship on Forage*.

## 📊 Project Overview
The project involved analyzing *retail sales data* to generate business insights and recommendations for the Tata team using Power BI.

I developed an interactive dashboard that visualizes:
- Total revenue trends
- Top-performing products
- Regional sales distribution
- Customer segment insights

## 🧠 Tools & Skills Used
- *Excel* — Data cleaning and preparation  
- *Power BI* — Dashboard creation and visualization  
- *SQL* — Querying and extracting key insights  

## 🚀 Key Insights
- Identified top 3 regions contributing most to revenue  
- Detected seasonal sales patterns and performance gaps  
- Suggested strategies to boost customer retention  

## 🎥 Project Demo
I created a short video presentation explaining the analysis process and dashboard insights.
